# Crop Yield Prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict crop yields, with a specific focus on rice production.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict rice yields based on various agricultural and environmental factors. While the dataset includes information on 22 different crops, this notebook concentrates solely on rice yield prediction as a proof of concept.

## Methodology
- **Data Analysis**: I started by exploring the agricultural dataset to understand the data distribution and identify any patterns or trends that could impact rice yield. This included visualizing the relationships between different variables and handling any missing data.
- **Feature Selection and Engineering**: I selected relevant features that are most likely to influence rice yields, such as soil composition, temperature, and rainfall. I then engineered these features to enhance the model's predictive power.
- **Model Implementation**: I implemented various machine learning algorithms to predict rice yields, experimenting with different models and tuning their parameters to improve accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: I assessed the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine which model provides the most accurate yield predictions. I also performed cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a starting point for crop yield prediction, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in agricultural forecasting. Future work could extend this approach to other crops in the dataset.
