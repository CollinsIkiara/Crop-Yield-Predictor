# Crop Yield Prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict crop yields, with a specific focus on rice production.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict rice yields based on various agricultural and environmental factors. While the dataset includes information on 22 different crops, this notebook concentrates solely on rice yield prediction as a proof of concept.

## Methodology
- Data analysis and preprocessing of agricultural datasets
- Feature selection and engineering
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for yield prediction
- Model evaluation and performance assessment

## Conclusion
This project serves as a starting point for crop yield prediction, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in agricultural forecasting. Future work could extend this approach to other crops in the dataset.
